Hi!
===

I'm Max Klein.
This is my personal website where I publish some of the projects I work on in my free time.

I mostly do electronics projects because I'm studying electrical engineering, but I also enjoy programming a lot which is why you'll find a few software projects.

Below are the ones that I'm most proud of. You can browse through all the projects using the menu at the top.
