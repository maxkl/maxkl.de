This is a simple game where you have to throw a pixel. The game is drawn to a 64x16 monochrome LED matrix. The ARM Cortex-M4F based microcontroller of the EK-TM4C123GXL development board simulates a two-dimensional grid-based world. There are destructible (hollow) and indestructible (filled) blocks that serve as obstacles. The goal is to hit and destroy all spheres/circles by correctly aiming and adjusting the throwing power.
